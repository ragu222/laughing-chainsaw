Simple Web Scraper

This is a python script to scrape printer's configuration pages for MAC addresses.

It accepts a csv file with a list of ip addresses, checks if port 80 is open 
and attempts to pull a string from the page.

This script is for a very specific purpose on a very specific set of IP addresses.

For example, I know I'm looking for the 21st string element (the MAC address inthis case) in the HTML.

My intention is to take this functional, yet narrow use case, script and general
ize it as much as I can.
